            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the enſuing tract was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at the immediate inſtance of, principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, and directed to a private friend: ſo I knew not but that it might have been confin'd to his cloſet. For my own part, I had cauſe enough to account it unworthy of a publique view; or to look forth into an age, wherein ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paſſeth that is not lyable to cenſure. Nor am I ignorant, that whatever becomes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, (unleſſe it appear in a polite dreſſe) is eſteemed contemptible. Nevertheleſſe, no ſooner was my pen and this paper divorced, but (through ſome ſecret intelligence, or (as I conceive) collateral knowledge of the thing) I met with importunities, more then a few, to exact my conſent, for its publication. But how little proportion that held with my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, thoſe with whom I conteſted can readily witneſſe. For, as I was willing to continue at a juſt diſtance, from any thoughts of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to my own net: ſo I could have been well ſatisfyed this had ſlept in a ſingle manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. Yet whatſoever I aſſerted in my own defence, wanted efficacy to ſatisfy my friends. Nothing leſſe then an abſolute grant of this
<pb facs="tcp:179225:3"/>particular, would ſuffice. Therefore being caſt upon this ſtraite, I rather choſe to ſtrike ſail, as an argument of my condeſcenſion; then expoſe my ſelf to the hazad of a farther encounter; &amp; thereupon reſolved to reviſe, and cloath it, with ſome additional thoughts. For (as empty veſſels are moſt receptive: ſo) I was very ſenſible 'twas not only capable of correction, but repletion too, as being the bare iſſue of ſome broken houres; yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was I much prevented, the copy having continued ſometime forth of my hands, upon enquiry, I found it committed to the preſſe with greater expedition then I expected, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was very requiſite, both in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to my ſelf and others, it ſhould not have ſeen the world, unleſſe in a better ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. But ſince it will abroad, as I have no ground to commend it: ſo no prevailing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to indulge it to thee, only transfer it to thy favorable view. And if thou maiſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it worth a leiſure hour, it's freely at thy devotion; and ſo farewel.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> Know it is not long, ſince you were pleaſed to expreſſe a very deep and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fence of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, and diſcontents that were too apparently predominant in the ſpirits of private men; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it was evident, that the wonder-working-hand of God, was immediately pointing at ſome very remarkeable deſign that had reference to his Church and People. And that which amaz'd you was, that mens eyes were not fixt upon it, but their minds carried on to
<pb facs="tcp:179225:4"/>an impetuous height of Impatience and diſcompoſure; I told you then it was the ſame conſideration, that had poſſeſſed my owne thoughts, wherein (by a private diſcuſſion or (as it were) a ſelf-Conference) they had aſſumed a large Liberty: upon which acknowledgement, it was your pleaſure to command ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from me upon this ſubject; whereunto I made no poſitive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; for what might principally induce you to this, I knew not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I then, nor do I yet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, unleſſe it were that ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I once gave you upon another particular.</p>
            <p>Whereupon returning to my Chamber, I was reduced to this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma:</hi> Either I muſt diſpence with your commands, (the thoughts whereof had a ſtrict influence upon me) or elſe I must appear in a work, whereto I was deeply ſenſible of my inſufficiency; ſo that to diſobey
<pb facs="tcp:179225:4"/>your Injunction, or to frame the thoughts, I told you of, into words, and then digeſt thoſe into a method fit for your view, both, to me were extreamly difficult. By this you may eaſily judge, what conflict I had with my ſelf; yet at laſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon obedience, concluding that the ſafest courſe, though other reſpects urged me to decline it. And although I cannot in the least meaſure pretend to any proficiency in, or aptneſſe to a Task of this Nature; yet I am willing to extend that power I have to its limit, and humbly pray it may be ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>What I offer in obedience to your Command, ſhall be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſented then in this <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;</hi> And that which you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to hint (in theſe words,) He that caſts his eye upon past ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, may <hi>obſerve,</hi> That ſometime a cure hath been wrought by very lowe and contemptible
<pb facs="tcp:179225:5"/>Meanes and Inſtruments, that hath been given over as deſperate, by Perſons of more profound knowledge and riper judgement, ſhall (without any further Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,) be my Encouragement to proceed as followeth.</p>

               <head>The Introduction.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Apprehend the greateſt part of the Chriſtian world groaning under the heavy burden of trouble and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and (being now in travel) <hi>labours</hi> with no leſſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of peril, then <hi>pangs,</hi> to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>And although many of us may be apt to plead, that we have been ſo far from declining, as that we have laid hold upon every occaſion, and endeavoured to make a faithful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all probable meanes that might tend to <hi>over-rule</hi> the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and give ſtop to its violence: Yet I humbly ſay, that it's much <hi>below</hi> the power of any <hi>Mortall</hi> to conquer in ſuch conflicts, without a great meaſure of Divine aſſiſtance; and I am confident, that <hi>many</hi> by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent addreſſes, have ſolicited at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens Throne in that particular; Yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179225:6"/>however the Almighty may, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſes beſt known to himſelf, for a time ſuſpend his help, though not abſolutely deny it, and alſo for ſome reſpects that fall within our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For it's not improbable, God does it to the end we may continue in a ſtate of dependance on him, that ſo, not onely thoſe other heavenly graces, that the Lord out of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable <hi>bounty</hi> hath vouchſafed <hi>us,</hi> but our faith alſo may be exerciſed, which is very acceptable and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to his ſacred Majeſty.</p>
               <p>And although we have formerly ſent up our ſupplications to Heaven for aide; perhaps we have at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, for our hearts are deceitfull beyond meaſure, had regard to ſome thing <hi>on</hi> earth, that in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeemed to hold forth <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this ground alone were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cauſe a ſuſpenſion of help. For Almighty God out of a tender regard to his glory, will not ſuffer any earthly thing to come in <hi>competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with heavenly; and as he would have his own way and meanes uſed towards the accompliſhing <hi>every end,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:179225:6"/>ſo his holy Name chiefly glorifyed. But in regard I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more to this purpoſe, before I period my Epiſtle, I will in the next place endeavour to <hi>make</hi> inquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the cauſes, that might poſſibly uſher in our diſcontents, and uſe my beſt diligence to remove them, that ſo the effects may ceaſe.</p>

               <p>It's no other then a light touch of natures tincture caſt upon the skinne, and how ſuddenly that's wiped off with a little ſickneſſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſualty, experience tells us: He that had the choiſe of many <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> faces, (as well as a plenitude of all other enjoyments) could ſay towards the period of his Proverbs,<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 31.30.</note> that <hi>favour is deceitful, and beauty is vanity;</hi> whereof wee may be very credulous, ſince we know not a more valid authority, then this of the wiſe-mans, that will maintain the contrary.</p>
               <p>Nor does Strength and Vigour of bodie (which is more chiefly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to our own ſex) carry with it a leſſe proportion of frailty, then the former: for though we could ſuſteine and hold it up to its ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate tearm, till hoary old age ſeize upon us; Alas! that's but a ſhort time; it greetes us before we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, often letting us know, by its decaying effects, that it hath us

But it may be obſerved, that many times, either ſolitary ſickneſſe or ſome waſting malady, prevents the decayings and debilitations of age, and ſo ſubjects the ſtouteſt man to a low condition, and pulls the ſtrongeſt upon his knees, cauſing him to confeſſe with the holy Preacher, that<note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.10.</note> 
                  <hi>youth as well as childhood is vanity.</hi> Another thing which ſeizes many, and hurries them headlong to their own ruine (unleſs well grounded upon pious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) is an Exceſſe of worldly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which may not improperly be called vanity in the abſtract, a meer <hi>extempory</hi> flaſh, far more imaginary, then real, which for the moſt part dies in the birth: But admit them petmanent; yet the conſideration

               <p>One would tremble to think what dangerous incendiaries they are to luſt; and that ſo emaſculates all the powers of the ſoul, that its nobleſt operations become brutiſh: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a wanton eye, a laſcivious eare, obſcene talk, unclean and filthy jeſts; beſides many other ſecret abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not to be conceived without horrour, much leſſe to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Therefore if we look upon ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>pleaſures,</hi> as they are in themſelves vain and tranſitory; or in their vile conſequenſes baſe and impious, they deſerve not to have harbour in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mind: but rather to be ejected and utterly baniſhed from our thoughts, as contemptible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of our notice.</p>
               <p>Thus I have plainly laid down the vanity and ſhort continuance of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179225:19"/>theſe laſt mentioned earthly felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and we may be ſatisfyed, that all other temporal enjoyments are ſubject to the ſame fate and mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

That Chymiſtry or ſacred art is onely proper to him, to whom all things are poſſible: That Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power can draw forth the vaſt ſpaces of eternity out of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time; can contract the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Ocean into the compaſs of a nut-ſhell, and the capacious Earth

               <p>Do we then upon ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration manifeſtly diſcern the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tranſitorineſſe of accumulated Riches, of adored Honour, of ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Beauty, of <hi>vigorous</hi> Strength, of delightful Pleaſures; yea and of Life it ſelf, and whatever elſe can be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as dear and precious to us in this world; and can we (upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts) ſo fix our hearts on them, and doat after them, as to be troubled and dejected with our parting from them? Sure it betraies a great meaſure of folly in any one to bewaile and afflict himſelf for the loſſe of that which he knowes muſt certainly decay and vaniſh: yet ſuch is the nature and condition of <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded-men,</hi> whoſe wills are ſo vitiated, affections miſguided, and underſtandings dark'ned, that they cannot ſee further. But wiſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians will value good things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Therefore let's be perſwaded, as a counter-ballance to the Creatures vanity (having already ſeen how <hi>fraile</hi> and tranſitory all outward and earthly enjoyments are, though their enticements be never ſo many, and ſeem to hold forth promiſes of a faire and pleaſing <hi>nature</hi>) ſtead faſtly ſo ſix our ſoules on thoſe things which are of a more <hi>Celeſtiall</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, thoſe ineſtimable Riches that are treaſured up in heaven, where neither moth nor ruff can ever poſſibly corrupt, nor theeves breake through and ſteale, which are beyond all thoughts of diminution or decay.

               <p>Then again, admit that to length of daies there were added, a fulneſſe of earthly bleſſings, and thoſe freed from many perplexities and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, wherewith they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompanied; yet very little ſatisfaction could the ſoul receive from them, or find in them: For without doubt if any thing of true contentment and of a comfortable durance could have been found i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179225:23"/>unſatisfyed, and thereupon the heart ſaies, it's not enough: the more it hath, the more it craves; diſcontentedly afflicting it ſelf, when it cannot attain to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, of its boundleſſe and unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſire. Nor is the proud and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious man leſſe perplext, when he cannot reach to the height of that honour, which his lofty ſpirit looks at: His aſpiring thoughts will prompt him to leave no waies or meanes unaſſayed (though never ſo dangerous and <hi>unwarrantable</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may poſſibly accompliſh that, which his thirſty mind aimes at; as we may plainly ſee in <hi>Hamans</hi> caſe. If in the next place we obſerve the Voluptious perſon, who bathes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in pleaſures, and ſwims through times ſwift current, with as much vain mirth and jollity, as a created capacity can ſuggeſt; yet all this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices not, ſo light and airie are all delights of this nature, that they paſſe away like a ſhadow, and are many times gone in the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their enjoying; In ſo much
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179225:23"/>that for the moſt part thoſe men which are voluptuouſly given, are forced to feed their humours upon a ſtock of paſt pleaſures, ſuffering their thoughts to run over with a kind of pleaſing liberty (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a moſt ſinful licen ciouſneſſe) the former paſſages of their vitious and voluptuous lives. And all this (if rightly conſidered) is ſo farre from adminiſtring true content, that it aggravates their miſery, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting a double depravity and guilt upon their own ſouls, which will one day reflect upon their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages with ſorrow and ſadneſſe, and bitterly condemne their own folly for giving way to ſuch irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and horrible courſes.</p>
               <p>Further if we look upon the Strong and Valiant man, we ſhall ſee how fraile and unſatisfying that is (as I have before more fully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) and how ſoon the moſt active and vigorous <hi>ſtrength</hi> becomes weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, either through the decaying of age, ſickneſſe, or other accidents. <hi>Sampſon</hi> (ſo famous in <hi>Holy Writ</hi>)

I might runne into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> multitude of Inſtances, of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures diſſatisfaction, were it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to protract time, then afford content. Therefore in a word. thus That if all the pleaſures and profits, earthly concernments and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ten thouſand worlds were heaped together, and became a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly; There is not ſo much effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to be found in all as would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the deſires of one <hi>Immortal ſoul</hi> and the reaſon is this; for that they are of a fraile and finite nature; and the ſoul purely infinite; they are material, but the ſoul immateriall; they are of a droſſy ſubſtance, but the ſoul made up of heavenly facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo that there can be no more true fellowſhip betwixt them then
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:179225:24"/>there is betwixt light and darkneſſe, which ſtand at an irreconcileable diſtance.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſince it appears that the choiſeſt of all outward endearments are ſo little ſatisfying, (or rather ſo much diſſatisfactory) It may induce us to give them a proportionable value and no more, and to ſix our hearts and affections on thoſe higher <hi>things</hi> that are of a more durable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; which we may be certain will not perturb our ſpirits, nor ſubject us to this deſtroying diſtemper of diſcontent.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:179225:28"/>ration of them, might enduce us to reſt ſatisfyed with a little. Firſt, Envy is an unavoidable companion of Greatneſſe, this body can never walk without that ſhadow, they are inſeparable: when on the contrary it ſcarce ever looks at a mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: low ſhrubs are ſeldome ſtruck with lightning; It is the lofty <hi>proud Cedars</hi> that are moſt lyable to thoſe devouring flames. <hi>David</hi> while he tended his fathers flocks lived <hi>merrily</hi> and without diſturbance; but when he once approaches the <hi>Court</hi> (though by <hi>Sacred Election</hi> and <hi>Appointment</hi>) and becomes arreſted with applauſe and greatneſſe; then <hi>emulation</hi> and <hi>envy, deſpight</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> purſue him cloſe at the heels; and though he forſake the <hi>Court,</hi> and wander in the <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> thither theſe <hi>blood-hounds</hi> follow him: If he fly to the land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> they'le find him out, and chaſe him to <hi>Ziklag:</hi> and though at laſt he arrive at his juſt Throne, and there hopes to breath a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all theſe tedious <hi>Encounters,</hi> yet ſtill he's accoſted with unquietneſſe,

               <p>He that falls from an high preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, cannot probably avoid bruiſes; but he that ſuffers a fall on even ground, is lyable to little or no harm. Is it not then much better to be ſafe in a lowe condition then mounted high and ſubject to ſo much peril? And then further, greatneſs can never continue without vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſquieting cares; that are ever ready to perplex both bed and board, to diſtract our ſleep, diſguſt our meat, embitter our pleaſures, and ſhorten our daies. Nor are the holyeſt of men free or exempted from theſe perturbations: By how much the higher they are advanced in outward <hi>things,</hi> ſo much the more trouble and vexation they ſhall meet with (either in reſpect of inſtruments or otherwiſe) in the managery of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:179225:29"/>thoſe affaires: For where earthly promotion is, diſtraction (in ſome degree) inſeparably attends it. That made <hi>Gregory,</hi> (none of the worſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) paſſionately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the clog of his high prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confeſſing though he was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly advanced, he was inwardly debaſed; and that the burthen of his honour did inſufferably depreſſe him, and his innumerable cares diſquiet him on all ſides. It was obſerved by the <hi>Jewiſh Doctors,</hi> that <hi>Joſeph</hi> the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> was of a ſhorter life then the reſt of his brethren, And this reaſon they render of it, that his cares were ſo much the more and greater, as his place and <hi>imployment</hi> was higher.</p>

               <p>IT's true, to quiet our ſelves in the contrariety of eſtates is difficult; yet by the aſſiſtance of Gods holy ſpirit, and the uſe of ſuch <hi>Sacred</hi> meanes as are appointed, it may be attained to. That which moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes us in this work, is our queri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous natures, that are hardly brought to know what they would have; and when they have it, are ignorant how to approve of it. Many would be happy; yet are extreamly unwilling to part from their houſes of clay: they love not to think of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, (which is the beginning of true happiniſſe, to thoſe that have made their calling and <hi>election</hi> ſure.) They deſire to have their lives pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, and drawn out to a large term, yet are loath to endure the troubles, and the decayings incident to old age. They expreſſe a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:179225:38"/>to be kept in order, and ſo to be made meet for their maſters uſe, yet cannot well digeſt the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of affliction. And thus in many inſtances of this kind, moſt men ſuffer a diſtraction in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of eſtates and conditions, and that in no ſmall meaſure, ſo long as perverſe nature is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: But if once Grace, (that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual habit of the ſoul) maſter and overcome that (otherwiſe untamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) monſter; (rebellious nature I mean) from thenceforth it becomes cowardly, unpowerful and dead, in reſpect of any prejudice it can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reduce us to.

                  <hi>High-Prieſt, (Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> who preſents our prayers, our <hi>praiſes,</hi> duties, ſervices and all our ſpiritual performances unto God the Father, and procures acceptance of him. At the very inſtant of our praying, he perfumes the Mercy-Seat (having before ſprinkled it with His bloud) and mingles our duties with His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions, and together, carries them upon the Golden Cenſer into the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holieſt,</hi> and there preſents them to his heavenly Father; unto whoſe ſacred preſence <hi>He</hi> takes our <hi>perſons</hi> (though not perceived by us)
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:179225:72"/>as knowing that if they be not acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, our prayers <hi>will</hi> not; for though by the Covenant of workes, God did firſt accept the <hi>work</hi> and <hi>then</hi> the <hi>perſon,</hi> yet in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> he firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts <hi>our perſons</hi>(in <hi>His Son</hi>) and then <hi>our</hi> performances. And that which is infinite comfort to every Chriſtian, becauſe that in our beſt eſtate, in our moſt refined Condition here below, we are ſubject to many failings and imperfections in our holyeſt duties: Therefore does our Eternal <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> diligently obſerve what evils, or infirmities attend our prayers, that may any waies interrupt their acceſſe to heaven, and thoſe he draws out, and takes quite away, before <hi>He</hi> preſent our petitions to <hi>His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Here is mercy in ſuch eminent manner, as cannot be ſufficiently expreſſed! And this is clearly held forth by that in<note n="*" place="margin">Ex. 28 &amp; Mal. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Exodus,</hi> where the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> after <hi>Moſes law</hi> (who was a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>) took away the iniquities of the <hi>Holy things</hi> of God's people.</p>
               <p>To proceed yet further, there is

If we do in faith and humility, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the throne of Grace, Almighty God, does moſt certainly, either grant that which we humbly and immediately deſire, or in lieue thereof, ſomething of an higher nature, that may more advantage us, or elſe (that which is a greater mercy then either of the former) he ſanctifyes the want of thoſe things to the ſatisfaction of our ſouls.</p>
